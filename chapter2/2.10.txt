what are the initial values if any of each of the following objects.?

global_str is global variable, so the value is empty string. global_int is global variable, 
so the value is zero. local_int is a local variable which is uninitialized, 
so it has a undefined value. local_str is also a local variable which is uninitialized,
but it has a value that is defined by the class. So it is empty string.
