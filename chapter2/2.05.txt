Determine character types
a: character literal, wide character litreal, string lirteral, wide strign literal

b: integer literal, intger unsigned literal, integer long literal, integer literal unsigned long, 
    octal integer literal 12, hexideimal integer literal 12

C: floating point literal, floating point float literal, floating point long literal

D: integer literal, integer unsigned literal, floating point literal, floating point literal

Explain the differences:

*   a string literal is an array of character literals, compiler appends 
    null character "\0" to every string literal.

*   decimal literal has smallest type of int, long, or long long. Octal and hexideciaml; havbe the smallest 
    type of intm unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, or nsigned long long. 

*   Integer literals may be stored i sign types but technically are never negative but have negative
    operand applied to them

*   Floating point literals include either a decimal point or an expnent in scientific notation
