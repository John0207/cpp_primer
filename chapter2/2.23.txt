given a pointer p, can you determine wether p points to a valid object or not? how or why not?

in short, no.

you can do things like 
if (p != nullptr)  // preferred new C++ standard
if (p != 0)
if (p != NULL)     // requires cstdlib header
if (!p)
if (p)

none of these will tell you if the object is valid if the value is not nullptr but is still invalid
