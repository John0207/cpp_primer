* Exercise 1.6: Explain whether the following program fragment is legal
 *
	 * std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
	 * << " and " << v2;
	 * << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
	 *
 * If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why
 * not? How would you fix it?

The code fragment is not legal. It has semicolons in what would otherwise be a long output statement
that clears the buffer at the end. This will cause a compiler error because it wont understand 
a line that starts with << with no left operator. It also does not clear cout before it would hit this error causing
a potentially confusing error code. 
To fix it you would need to remove semicolons after v1 and v2. 
v1 and v2 also need to be declared before they are used.
finally the function should end with return 0. This doesnt need to be there but is used to show 
that the function ran properly.
